- This repository contains different levels of Go code, it's my progress in the language.
- Each file is named according to the topic that i learned.
- Many of that code will be refactored that as i get better.

### Observation:
- Some scripts have **v2** tag in the end of name. It's improved version. I keept both to look the different approaches.
